### Term project for CSCI 182 - Web and Data Mining at Santa Clara University

For this project, we used the Twitter API and data mining techniques to search Twitter for mentions of different programing languages, and perform basic sentiment analysis to determine if each language is seen in a positive, negative, or neutral light.
